# Kilordle Solver

A Kilordle solver, given 2 files, this can try to find combinations of words to minimise the amount of guesses.

The 2 files needed:
- Wordles.txt - All the possible Wordles to be guessed
- Words.txt - All other acceptable words by the Kilordle

I used [this](https://jonesnxt.github.io/kilordle/) as my Kilordle, it is made by jones (who I think is the original creator of the Kilordle idea).

I decided to do this after watching [3Blue1Brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) about using information theory on Wordle. I originally did this in Python and found it slow so made a Java version.
